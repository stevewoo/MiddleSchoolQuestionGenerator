# 6460 Educational Technology Project
## Open question generation for Middle School science students

This project aims to implement an open question generator based on text input using natural language processing techniques. It is designed for articles and textbooks related to science at a middle school age, but may also be useful in other contexts. Questions are generated based upon an analysis of the keywords, word difficulty, and question applicability to each sentence, and aligned to Bloom's Taxonomy of Thinking.
